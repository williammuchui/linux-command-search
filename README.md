## Makefile

The project includes a Makefile to simplify the build and installation process. Here are the available commands:

- `make build`: Compiles the project
- `make install`: Installs the project to ~/commands and provides instructions for updating PATH
- `make clean`: Removes build files
- `make help`: Shows the help message with available commands

To install the project, run:

```
make install
```

After installation, follow the instructions provided to add the installation directory to your PATH. You'll need to add a line to your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc) and then either source the file or restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Customization

You can easily add or modify commands by editing the `linux` file in the project root. Each line should follow this format:

```
[command_name]  Command description
```
